# My First Website

**Description:** This project is the first webpage I have ever designed and made functional. 

**How to Run:** In order to run this, you have to download all files: .html, .css, .js AND the images (.jpg). They must all be stored in the same folder in order to run together and animate the movement. 

**Future improvements:** This exercise could be improved by: 1) creating additional sections, 2) including additional coding samples, and 3) embed a collab section. 

**License:** Created during and for MIT coursework (Professional Coding Women's Cohort certificate).
